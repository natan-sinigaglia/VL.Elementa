#### Changed/Updated
- Changed pin names in Layout nodes. `Inherit Size From Children` and all similar names are now `Auto Size`
- Masked irrelevant pins for some Layout nodes
- Layout nodes now have an optionnal pin to that draws a helper stroke to visualize them more easily
- Boolean widgets (bang, toggle, press) now have a new default drawer making it more obvious if they're true or not

### 3.0.0

- NEW Style system. there's no StyleSheet property anymore in IElementum interface (everything gets managed by the Styleable component, already implemented within every widget)
- NEW "Selector" utility library to validate conditions within an entity-component tree graph (used for the style system)
- NEW css file parser (builds an Elementa StyleSheet)

- NEW Formattable component
- NEW Grid layout node
- NEW Root architecture with pluggable component processors
- NEW EditBehaviour options for some widgets: AbsoluteEditing/RelativeEditing/StickyEditing
- FIX in ToSkiaLayer (in Root): disabled skia rendering in the first frame to avoid UI flickering (due to frame delays in retrieving the bounds from renderer)
- FIX in IntegerUpDown behaviour (wasn't updating Min and Max values in idle)
- Refactoring of Layour nodes: proper cached mechanism that improves a lot performances and better modularization of the internal components.
- Layout nodes come just with a Spectral version (no pingroup version anymore)
- All widgets now come with a Spectral version (that expect a component spread as input, not using pingroup)
- Styleable component now as advanced, not meant to be plugged to the widgets to customize their style
- Taggable component reworked: now it simply contains an `HashSet<Object>`. it comes also as a (Spectral Advanced) version, with no pingroup.
- Attributable component got refreshed as well: attributes come as `Dictionary<String, Object>` 
- renamed Typeable component to Focusable
- Rotary widget now internally made with a slider (since they share the same behaviour).
